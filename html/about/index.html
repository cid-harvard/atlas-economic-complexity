    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    
    <p>The Atlas online is a powerful interactive tool that enables users to visualize a country’s total trade, track how these dynamics change over time and explore growth opportunities for more than a hundred countries worldwide.</p>

    <p>The Atlas is used by investors, entrepreneurs, policymakers, students and the general public to better understand the competitive landscape of countries around the globe. For any given country, The Atlas shows which products are produced and exported; The Atlas can then use this information to suggest products a country could begin manufacturing in order to fuel economic growth. As a dynamic resource, The Atlas is continually evolving with new data and features to help analyze economic growth and development.</p>

    <p>The Atlas can answer questions such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What does a country import and export?</li>
      <li>How has its trade evolved over time?</li>
      <li>What are the drivers of export growth?</li>
      <li>Which new industries are likely to emerge in a given geography? Which are likely to disappear?</li>
      <li>What are the GDP growth prospects of a given country in the next 5-10 years, based on its productive capabilities?</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="origin"></a>
    <h3>Origin</h3>
    
    <p>The Atlas online was originally conceived of as a versatile, interactive tool to make trade data not only available, but also usable and to synthesize insights from research on <a href="about/glossary/#economiccomplexity">Economic Complexity</a>. </p>

    <p>Research into Economic Complexity was led by Ricardo Hausmann, Professor of the Practice of Economic Development at the Harvard Kennedy School and CID Director, and Cesar A. Hidalgo, Asahi Broadcast Corporation Career Development Professor at MIT. CID published this research in <i>The Atlas of Economic Complexity: Mapping Paths to Prosperity</i>, a comprehensive study of national growth trajectories and analyses. The Atlas online was originally built as part of lead developer Alexander Simoes’ masters thesis at the MIT Media Lab, with Cesar A. Hidalgo as his thesis advisor.</p>

    <p>The Atlas online is the result of the contribution and hard work of many individuals. Additional help in the development of the platform was provided by Ali Almossawi, Crystal Noel, David Landry, Sarah Chung and Eric Franco. Original versions of the datasets were provided by Muhammed Yildirim, Sebastian Bustos, Michele Coscia and Juan Jimenez. The Atlas online is currently being managed at the Center for International Development.</p>

    <a name="cid"></a>
    <h3>Center for International Development</h3>

    <p>Development has been the central story of the human experience for the last two centuries. Many countries have emerged from poverty to achieve incredible improvements in living standards—including nutrition, shelter, clean water, education and health. But many countries are still mired in poverty. What can these societies do to achieve and sustain the levels of prosperity that we know are possible? This is the question that animates our work at Harvard’s Center for International Development (CID).</p>

    <p>CID, a university-wide research center housed at the Harvard Kennedy School, serves as a convening mechanism for breakthrough research that connects emerging insights with policymakers and practitioners. Many organizations focus on poverty alleviation, supporting worthy goals such as disease prevention, disaster relief, and education. CID takes this strategy one step further: our mandate is to uncover the causes of these problems and search for their long-term solutions.</p>

    <p>CID has four academic research programs:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid/programs/building_state_capability">Building State Capability</a> identifies potential solutions to “capability traps”—a situation in which a developing country’s state capability stagnates even as resources continue to flow. Building State Capability has developed an innovative, alternative approach: “Problem-Driven Iterative Adaptation” (PDIA). Consisting of four core principles, PDIA aims to change how organizations and policies function, as opposed to just changing what they look like. Building State Capability is led by an interdisciplinary team of faculty, including Lant Pritchett, Matt Andrews and Michael Woolcock.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid/programs/growth-lab">The Growth Lab</a> investigates questions of economic growth, including growth constraints and growth disparities. Led by Ricardo Hausmann, Lant Pritchett and Dani Rodrik, the Growth Lab works to translate insights on growth into more effective policymaking in developing countries.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid/programs/evidence-for-policy-design">Evidence for Policy Design</a> (EPoD) utilizes the tools of microeconomics to find solutions to questions of policy design in low-income countries. EPoD also engages in policy dialogues and trains policymakers to utilize analytical tools and frameworks for smarter policymaking. EPoD is led by Rohini Pande and Asim Khwaja.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid/programs/entrepreneurial-finance-lab-research-initiative">Entrepreneurial Finance Lab Research Initiative</a> (EFLRI) evaluates the impact of psychometric screening tools and alternative financial contracts on access to finance and entrepreneurial growth in the developing world's "missing middle." EFLRI is led by Asim Khwaja.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Macro Connections at MIT Media Lab</h3>

    <p>The <a href="http://macro.media.mit.edu/">Macro Connections group</a>, housed at MIT Media Lab, focuses on the development of analytical tools that can help improve our understanding of the world’s macro structures in all of their complexity. By developing methods to analyze and represent complex networks—such as the networks connecting countries to the products they export, or historical data to their modern counterparts—Macro Connections’ research aims to improve our understanding of the world by putting together the pieces that our scientific disciplines have pulled apart.</p>
