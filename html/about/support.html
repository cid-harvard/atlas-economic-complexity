    <p>The gift supports the Growth Lab faculty and fellows as they further research on the questions of what policies allow countries to grow.  Building on the Lab’s scholarship in Growth Diagnostics and Structural Transformation, the Standard Bank gift allows the Growth Lab to focus its research on emerging economies in Africa and to apply innovative analytical tools that can unlock the mysteries of growth.  Finally, the gift supports the Growth Lab faculty and fellows to engage directly with government actors in key countries and bring the Growth Lab’s lessons to an audience of current and future policy makers within emerging African economies.</p>
